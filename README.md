# :ticketbox

:ticketbox is a fast, minimalistic case/ticket management software. It has many features, some of them are:

 - Create tickets, ticket categories, users, groups, assets, businesses and asset locations.
 - Easy updating the status of tickets, including important information about them
 - View the most necessary information in your dashboard, including charts that distribute ticket activity by week or month, public activity of your agents or the top hot tickets that are pending or in progress right now.
 - View your assets by location (e.g. by floor or building), users by business and other useful stuff.

## Built With

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) &mdash; The backend API is a Rails app.
